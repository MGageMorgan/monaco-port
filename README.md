#  MGageMorgan's monaco-port
The Monaco skin with Vector buttons and latest MediaWiki compatibility

## SIDEBOXES!!!!
I found the "Messages" source code and a snippet that they included just for ShoutWiki's implementation of Monaco, and I grabbed it for us,
as you can see in this skin. I invite you to modify it for your own site.

Also, I have to thank the three people that came before me to mod the skin to work with more recent versions of MediaWiki, namely James
Haley and Arcane. Both did great in bringing things up to speed and I thank them for keeping interest even though the rest of
the world may not.
